# Responsive UI Components

> This is a repo of non-functional UI components written in HTML & CSS. Each component shows responsive design and behavior patterns. The designs come from [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com).

## Demo Information

Fully functional demos can be invoked if you have `live-server` installed. Simply copy the project files to your local machine. Then in your code editor, right click the index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server". The contents of the application will display in the next available port in your default browser.

```
npm install -g live-server
```

For more information on live-server you can visit the link here https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server.
